## 2. Dataset and EDA 
## 3. Preprocessing and Feature Extraction 
### 3.1. Text Data
### 3.1. Image Data

## 4. Modelling
### 4.1. NLP Models
### 4.2. Computer Vision Model
### 4.3. Ensembled Model
Base models to ensemble NLP name and NLP name + descriptions and image model
**Notebook ensembled model I**  - Here we explore different combinations of models based on different weights. Here we saved the different models 
**Notebook ensembled model II** ensembled model selected in the previous notebook and that will be backed our API. 

## 5. Model Evaluation

## 6. Improvement Proposals
